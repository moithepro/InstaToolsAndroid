# InstaToolsAndroid
 Instagram GUI (only unfollowers for now) Tools using [chaquopy](https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy) and [instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) - PyPI
### Features:
 * Keeping track of unfollowers
 * Whitelisting unfollowers 
 * Logging in with any account to access all other private or public profiles 
 * Keeping stats of 3 different profiles
 * Keeping Instagram login session after closing app
 * A modern simplistic UI


 
* The scraping is slow because of rate limiting!!! instagram does not allow to scrape data too quick as they will block you from doing so.
* I strongly advice using an alternate account to login in the app.
